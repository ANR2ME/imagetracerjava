# imagetracerjava
Simple raster image tracer and vectorizer written in Java for desktop.

by Andr√°s Jankovics 2015

This is a port of imagetracer.js , please read that for more details: https://github.com/jankovicsandras/imagetracerjs/blob/master/README.md 

I will try to update this documentation as soon as I have enough time. :)
An Android version is planned also, the only difference will be that Android has no javax.imageio which is used for image loading, so a new loadImageData() function is required.


### Run as a standalone program 

Basic usage: 
```
java -jar ImageTracer.jar <filename>
```

With options:
```
java -jar ImageTracer.jar <filename> ltres 1 qtres 1 pathomit 8 numberofcolors 16 mincolorratio 0.02 colorquantcycles 3 scale 1 lcpr 0 qcpr 0
```

### Initialization
Include ImageTracer.java in your project, then create an ImageTracer object:
```
ImageTracer it = new ImageTracer();
```

### Examples
#### Example 1
Basic usage: loading image, tracing, creating SVG string, saving SVG string as a new file
```
saveString("output.svg",
    imageToSVG("input.jpg",null)
);
```

#### Example 2
With options
```
HashMap<String,Float> options = new HashMap<String,Float>();

// Tracing
options.put("ltres",1f);
options.put("qtres",1f);
options.put("pathomit",8f);

// Color quantization
options.put("numberofcolors",16f);
options.put("mincolorratio",0.02f);
options.put("colorquantcycles",3f);

// SVG rendering
options.put("scale",1f);
options.put("lcpr",0f);
options.put("qcpr",0f);

saveString("output.svg",
    imageToSVG("input.jpg",options)
);
```

There are more functions for advanced users, read the source if you are interested. :)
	
### Options
|Option name|Default value|Meaning|
|-----------|-------------|-------|
|ltres|1|Error treshold for straight lines. Use 0.001 instead of 0 if only round splines are required.|
|qtres|1|Error treshold for quadratic splines. Use 0.001 instead of 0 if only straight lines are required.|
|pathomit|8|Edge node paths shorter than this will be discarded for noise reduction. Use 1 instead of 0 to get paths around single pixels.|
|numberofcolors|16|Number of colors to use on palette if pal object is not defined.|
|mincolorratio|0.02|Color quantization will randomize a color if fewer pixels than (total pixels*mincolorratio) has it.|
|colorquantcycles|3|Color quantization will be repeated this many times.|
|scale|1|Every coordinate will be multiplied with this, to scale the SVG.|
|lcpr|0|Straight line control point radius, if this is greater than zero, small circles will be drawn in the SVG. Do not use this for big/complex images.|
|qcpr|0|Quadratic spline control point radius, if this is greater than zero, small circles and lines will be drawn in the SVG. Do not use this for big/complex images.|
